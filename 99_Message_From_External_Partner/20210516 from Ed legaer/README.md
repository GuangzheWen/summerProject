Hi Jian and Wayne,

Great to hear from you both the other day. As always, get in touch if you have any questions!

As discussed here is information:

1) Booking System


Two users: 1. Client 2. Barber

For the client…
 \- After navigating to the individual barbers booking page, the client will have the option to view and book from slots available for the barber
 \- In booking appointment, client will have to input card details (and pay a £5 deposit - no worries if this is not possible though)

For the barber…
 \- Barber can put available slots into calendar that will be viewed by client
 \- Barber will be able to view all booked clients
 \- Possible additional feature… Barber can accept / reject booking when client tries to book slot

Both…
 \- Have the option to cancel bookings. If client cancels with less than 12 hours notice, then he will have to pay half of cut amount

This is different to a conventional booking system (used in a barber shop etc.), as each barber will have their own separate booking system & calendar. In a barber shop, there is one calendar / system that is used across all barbers.

2) Design

At a high-level, we are looking for a red, white and blue colour theme in line with a 'classic' barber logo e.g.

But feel free to make your own decisions with the details of the design.

3) Some general information on the project can be found on the powerpoint attachment.

Many thanks,

Jimmy, Ed and Pete
